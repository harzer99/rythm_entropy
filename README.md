# rythm_entropy
calculates rhythm complexity from the entropy of the sub audible spectrum

use the notebook to analyze a video or better a playlist. Whole albums in one file tend to overestimate the entropy as it is multiple songs with different tempos analzyed together. Also songs with varying tempos tend to have a very high score despite the rhythm and structure being fairly simple
